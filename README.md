An Arduino based music player. Plays back audio file playlists based on the the rfid tag the program recieves
over the computer's serial port from an Arduino microcontroller. Uses the StrongLink SL018 (13.56MHz Mifrare) RFID tag reader library. Also makes use of the pyserial library - http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/.
