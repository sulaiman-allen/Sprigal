# Yomu
An Arduino based music player. Plays back audio file playlists based on the the rfid tag the program recieves (written in Python) over the computer's serial port from an Arduino microcontroller. Uses the StrongLink [SL018](http://www.stronglink-rfid.com/en/rfid-modules/sl018.html) (13.56MHz Mifrare) RFID tag reader library. Also makes use of the pyserial library - http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/.
